            <h3>Who?</h3>
            <p> The project was made by Preston, Preston, Alex, and Quan
                for <b>MapHacks@UW 2018.</b></p>
            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>A web app visualizing the ideal locations for <b>new Link Light Rail
               stations</b> in Seattle.</p>
            <h3>When?</h3>
            <p>This analysis was conducted in Spring 2018.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>Seattle is in gridlock! Surface transit has become crippling for cars, buses, 
               and bicycles alike. We need a grade-separated Link to the future!</p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>A location allocation analysis for stations based on job and population
               density, as well as existing Link and bus facilities. No attempt was
               made to analyze routing or feasibility.</p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
          The Link system is convenient for a lot of people. Link stations are characterized by long distances separating them and speed. For those who so not own a car, having access to Link could be the most efficient way to get around. The goal of our project was to propose a new location for construction and justify our reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
          According to the Puget Sound Transit expansion plan, new stations are to be built in UDistrict, connected to the UW Husky Stadium, and Ballard, the end station of a line connecting Westlake Station. These two locations will be far apart from each other, with no stations in between to connect them to each other, leaving the people around Green Lake with little access to Link.
          </p>
          <p>
    This does not seem to be a reasonable plan considering the amount of people that live around Green Lake. As data from the 2010 census shows, communities around Green Lake are among the most densely populated in Seattle. However, they have the least access to public transportation. Presuming that many of the residents work in downtown, with a car, they can get there within 20 minutes. Those without one would have to take buses for nearly twice the amount of time. Buses during rush hour tend to have schedules that are unreliable, making commuting even more inconvenient.
          </p>
          <p>
          If a Link station can be built south of Green Lake, it could serve as an in-between meeting point for the residents in the area, and downtown would be more accessible to them.
